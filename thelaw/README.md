# Analysis

This folder contains the R code I wrote to test Lawler's Law and the reasons behind its varying success.

It's written in a series of R Markdown (.Rmd) files meant to be run in order. Here they are, with links to their respective markdown (.md) files for ease of reading on GitHub.com. More details about the code and process are contained within each.
