# Who won each game?

This can be inferred from the game log easily.

```{r}
start = 1951
end = 2019

pb = txtProgressBar(min = start, max = end) 

for (i in start:end) {
  glog = read_csv(
    str_c('../data/logs/log-', i, '.csv'),
    col_types = cols(GAME_ID = col_character())
  )
  
  final = glog %>% 
    # negative plus-minus means the home team won ...
    mutate(WINNER = case_when(PLUS_MINUS < 0 ~ 'HOME', TRUE ~ 'AWAY')) %>% 
    # ... but only in games that are listed as where the matchup is "AWAY @ HOME"
    filter(str_detect(MATCHUP, '@')) %>% 
    select(GAME_ID, WINNER, MATCHUP)
  
  write_csv(
    final,
    str_c('processed/winners-', i, '.csv')
  )

# Distill the play-by-play

The play-by-play is long and includes virtually every event in the game. Scoring is the only thing that matters here.
