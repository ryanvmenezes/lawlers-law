# Lawler's Law

"There's Lawler's Law, folks. First to 100 wins. It's the law."

This oft-repeated phrase by Clippers television broadcaster Ralph Lawler has been the subject of my personal fascination for a long time. Now it's the subject of an L.A. Times story.

It ran as the [Column One](https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/la-sp-col1-basketball-clippers-lawlers-law-20190416-htmlstory.html), a spot for special feature stories, on Apr. 16, 2019.

I also wrote a little bit about [why my background motivated me](https://www.latimes.com/columnone/la-sp-col1-lawlers-law-basketball-math-20190416-story.html) to do this deep dive.

The code and data contained here outline my process for the analysis behind the story. I used python (version 3.6) and R (3.4).

## Part 1: Getting the data

The `data` folder contains the process for gathering the data. It's written using two python scripts, both contained within jupyter notebooks. Check that folder's [README](/data/) for more.

## Part 2: Testing Lawler's Law

The `thelaw` folder contains the code that did the analysis. It's written in R, spread across some R Markdown files. That folder's [README](/thelaw/) has a table of contents.
