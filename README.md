# Lawler's Law

"There's Lawler's Law, folks. First to 100 wins. It's the law."

This oft-repeated phrase by Clippers television broadcaster Ralph Lawler has been the subject of my personal fascination for a long time. Now it's the subject of an L.A. Times story.

The code and data contained here outline my process for the analysis behind the story.

## Part 1: Getting the data

The `data` folder contains the process for gathering the data. It's written using two python scripts, both contained within jupyter notebooks. Check that folder's [README](/data/README.md) for more.

## Part 2: Testing Lawler's Law

The `thelaw` folder contains the code that did the analysis. It's written in R, spread across some R Markdown files. That folder's [README](/thelaw/README.md) has a table of contents.
